The randomize feature randomly selects an anime from the database and displays its information to the user.  This may help an indecisive user select an anime to watch.  At the top of the window are two buttons: the Back to Home button and the Randomize button.  The Back to Home button returns the user to the home screen while the Randomize button selects another anime randmly to display to the user in the window.

The genre search feature allows users to find an anime based on genre and subgenre.  The window is split into three sections: directions, genre selection, and genre options.  The directions sections shows the rules that the genre algorithm operates by.  The genre selection section allows a user to differentiate between main and sub genres with a button.  The type selected will be show in text below the two buttons.  In the middle of this section, the main and sub genres will be shown.  A clear button has also been added to clear all the genres and subgenres selected and start anew.  The Specific Search button should be pressed to search for an anime with the selected genres and subgenres.  If no anime fits the selected criteria, the user will be prompted to change their genre selections and try again.

The MAL's Top Ten feature showcases the top ten ranked anime, based on average MAL score, in the databse.  MAL ratings are from a community consensus and can be found at http://myanimelist.net.  These shows are often very popular, and most anime fans have watched or at least heard of them.  
### My Top Ten Feature
The My Top Ten features showcases the top ten anime based on my enjoyment rating.  These anime, in my opinion, were highly enjoyable, and I recommend new anime watchers watch them.  
### Alphabetized Feature
The Alphabetized feature alphabetizes the database based on English name and shows the user the results; may give users a sense of order so they can select an anime with more ease.
